## Step 1: Shopping cart
You are building a checkout system for a shop which only sells apples and oranges.  

Apples cost 60p and oranges cost 25p.

Build a checkout system which takes a list of items scanned at the till and outputs the total cost

For example: [ Apple, Apple, Orange, Apple ] => Â£2.05

Make reasonable assumptions about the inputs to your solution; for example, many candidates take a list of strings as input
 
## Step 2: Simple offers

The shop decides to introduce two new offers

buy one, get one free on Apples

3 for the price of 2 on Oranges

## Step 3: Mix offer

Shop now sell Bananas for 100p each

Buy one get one offer can be applied to the mix of apple and bananas

When applying offer, cheapest of two should be free

## Step 4: Add more fruits
 
Shop now sell Melons

There is no offer on Melon
  
## Step 5: Customer friendly buy one get one free offer
   
Offer should be applied to the pair of same priced item to get maximum discount for customers

2 apples and 2 bananas should cost 160p
